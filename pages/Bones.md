			- 11:21 Good morning.
			- I am trying to see if I can turn this to something like [[Dynalist]]
			- I won't be using the daily notes but instead I'll just write here in what I call Matrix. I'll probably change the name too.
			- One advantage here is that the notes will be saved in [[Github]] and I can just clone it later in my laptop.

			- I am happy with how the curtain room divider turned out. We just need a couple more things and the house will be homey.
			- Sofas is a priority. Something to sit on during the day and not stay on the bed all the time.
			- 07:05 I really am liking [[Logseq]] right now. I think I'll use this instead of [[Dynalist]].
			- I need to complete a lot of records for yesterday's production.
				- Changed the theme. I am liking the brown color.
			- 10:45 Feeling good listening to a funky songs.
			- So far I finished ninety records. Not bad really. considering I only worked half day yesterday.
			- 11:55 Finished one hundred ten records for yesterday.
			- 15:05 Took a nap. I just got up. Pretty good sleep though.
			- I just read a comment in [[Reddit]] that what I am doing right now is just writing ideas/brainstorming and not actual note taking/learning.
				- I think he has a point as I am pretty much just logging my thoughts. As of right now there's not much value in this.
			- [[Angel]]  bought curtains and wallpaper in Lazada. Next we will try to buy a sofa and either rugs or linoleum.
				- We are trying to be cost efficient in trying to furnish our home.
			- TODO Visit mother's lot in Bataan #family

			- 07:36 I woke up a little late again this morning. I had a good sleep but I woke up earlier with dream of something I am not sure happened in real life.
				- I keep having dreams like this.
			- Finished yesterday's production with one hundred fourteen but [[Cons]] qa'ed me this morning and I have not dispatched at least twenty records.
			- DONE Go home to Pulilan [[Nov 27th, 2021]] #family

			- 08:19 Good morning.
			- Moved the metal shelf and the position of the TV. Let's see how it looks later.
			- The wallpaper that [[Angel]] ordered was delivery earlier. We will try to install it this afternoon.
				- 16:30 Angel is now putting masking tape to the gaps and the rivet heads.
				- It looks like we need to install the wallpaper twice so that the underlying tape won't show.

			- It looks like [[Logseq]] will deprecating [[Github]] feature. I will need to look to a different application. That sucks.
			- Transferred my [[Logseq]] Matrix into [[Roam Research]].
			- I have not read anything this past few months. I have a lot of backlog of [[Books]] to read.
			- Installed [[Lux]], a dark mode custom css theme.
			- ^^One of the theories that gives great insight on the first question—how to be sure we find happiness in our careers—is from [[Frederick Herzberg]], who asserts that the powerful motivator in our lives isn’t money; it’s the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized for achievements.^^ #quotes #career

			- We got curtains from [[Lazada]].
				- It was delivered at our gate. That's awesome. It happened three times already and I think the more we shop online the easier it'll get.
			- Finished yesterday's production with one hundred eight. Thanks to [[Angel]], she helped me a lot this past two days.

			- 16:41 Good afternoon.
			- We finally bought a sofa. It will likely be delivered tomorrow. We chose a brown colored sectional sofa. It'll cost nine thousand pesos including the delivery fee.
				- This is huge as I feel sofa will be used everyday and having one is such a quality of life improvement.
			- My father has some eye injuries probably due to the ceiling installation. I hope they'get it checked. I gave one thousand pesos. Hope it won't get worse.
			- We also gave two thousand pesos to Angel's parents.
			- I feel good. A little sleepy though.
			- We forgot our external hard drive in Angel's bedroom.

			- My theme in [[Logseq]] is more beautiful than the one in [[Roam Research]]. It's just sad that the support for [[Github]] will be deprecated. But the desktop application is not ready. It's still in beta. I think I can still continue using this and then just download the Github file and put in the [[Google Drive]] folder.
			- Found this topic about [[building serendipity]]

			- Good morning.
			- I woke up late today, it was raining the whole night and it was cold. It's great to stay in the bed a little longer.
				- We had a great breakfast. [[Angel]] tried cooking pesto. It's kinda good but we forgot the cheese. It would have been better if we use a food processor or a mortar/pestle.
			- I've been reading the book called [[The Stargazey]] by [[Martha Grimes]].
				- I've read until the sixth chapter. I've tried reading it a couple of times before but it never clicked but I kinda like it now.
			- I'll relax today. I'll read a book and watch some vidoes.

			- Just got back from the market.
			- My laptop is slow. There's a delay when I type. Some letters are left out.
			- I'm having trouble upgrading [[EndeavorOS]] and the three [[AUR]] packages. I'm thinking it might be related to the slowness of the laptop.
			- Fixed my issues with [[Logseq]]. I just logged out and logged back in.
			- Took a shower this noon. I am not feeling well. I think I'll have a fever soon.
