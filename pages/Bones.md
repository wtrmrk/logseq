	- 11:21 Good morning.
	- I am trying to see if I can turn this to something like [[Dynalist]]
	- I won't be using the daily notes but instead I'll just write here in what I call Matrix. I'll probably change the name too.
	- One advantage here is that the notes will be saved in [[Github]] and I can just clone it later in my laptop.

	- 06.47 Good morning.
	- ^^“Was this the inevitable end? Were you just a passenger? Did your life just happen to you, or did you choose it?” - William, [[Westworld]]^^ #quotes
	- I am happy with how the curtain room divider turned out. We just need a couple more things and the house will be homey.
	- Sofas is a priority. Something to sit on during the day and not stay on the bed all the time.
	- 07:05 I really am liking [[Logseq]] right now. I think I'll use this instead of [[Dynalist]].
	- I need to complete a lot of records for yesterday's production.
		- Changed the theme. I am liking the brown color.
	- 10:45 Feeling good listening to a funky songs.
	- So far I finished ninety records. Not bad really. considering I only worked half day yesterday.
	- 11:55 Finished one hundred ten records for yesterday.
	- 15:05 Took a nap. I just got up. Pretty good sleep though.
	- I just read a comment in [[Reddit]] that what I am doing right now is just writing ideas/brainstorming and not actual note taking/learning.
		- I think he has a point as I am pretty much just logging my thoughts. As of right now there's not much value in this.
	- [[Angel]]  bought curtains and wallpaper in Lazada. Next we will try to buy a sofa and either rugs or linoleum.
		- We are trying to be cost efficient in trying to furnish our home.
	- TODO Visit mother's lot in Bataan #family
	- TODO Funds for lot measurement and land titling. #family #finance
	- Downloaded [[Spiderman 2]]

	- 07:36 I woke up a little late again this morning. I had a good sleep but I woke up earlier with dream of something I am not sure happened in real life.
		- I keep having dreams like this.
	- Finished yesterday's production with one hundred fourteen but [[Cons]] qa'ed me this morning and I have not dispatched at least twenty records.
	- TODO Go home to Pulilan [[Nov 27th, 2021]] #family
