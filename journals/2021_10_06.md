- 07:01 Good morning. I only finished eighty four records yesterday. I took a long break in the afternoon. I should have work while [[Angel]] is still on her laptop. But anyways today is a better day.
- I found out yesterday that my office mate Jhen managed to get an incentive worth ten thousand pesos that's a lot. I hope I can do the same.
- Love reading the answers to this thread

- One thing about reinstalling Linux that I hate is that I have to manually set up the laptio again
- I installed i3 but Gnome was also installed.
- DONE Bimonthly meeting at 10:00 AM
- TODO [[Oct 8th, 2021]] Gale Monthly Meeting
- I think I should schedule my vaccination as soon as possible. [[Angel]] will likely get her vaccine at Pulilan.
- I saw a schedule for Friday in SM North so that's good. And I think I can have my father take me there. That would be great.
- I always have these thoughts that I would like to get organized. That I need to track what I do and what I plan.
