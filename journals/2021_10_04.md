- 15:47 Good afternoon. I reinstalled [[EndeavorOS]] and [[Bodhi Linux]]
	- EndeavorOS looks a little heavier than my previous install. I wonder why.
	- Bodhi Linux looks good though. I think I might use it for a little while.
- I've replaced the old leaking water pipe with a new one. I made a mistake earlier, I have the part backwards but my father corrected me so it's all good.
- We will have the same incentive plan for October. My target is to average one hundred thirty and have a incentive of at least seven thousand pesos.
- Seeing this theme on [[Logseq]], it actually looks great. I really like it. It is easy to read, the links looks great.
- TODO Average one hundred thirty records for October
